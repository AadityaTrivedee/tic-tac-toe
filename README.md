# tic-tac-toe
This is one of my first projects where I try to create a Tic Tac Toe game through python. Nothing out-of-the-box, just an old-school classics. :) 

The game loops around and allows you to play multiple games while also tracking your previous wins. As input, you must enter the number placed on the cells of the tic tac toe chart and then looks for any possible wins. If no winning situation is to be seen, the program then looks for tie conditions. The program checks for wins and ties after every move.
